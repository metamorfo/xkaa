Just an attempt to rewrite xcow using python. Kaa is the python in the Jungle Book
and it also sounds a bit like xcow from xcowsay.

The snake (and the other animals) image is a freeware from Martin Berube and it was
taken from http://www.softicons.com/animal-icons/animal-icons-by-martin-berube/snake-icon

the default font comes from : http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/benveno
